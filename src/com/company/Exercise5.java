//    The Captain Crunch decoder ring works by taking each letter in a string and adding 13 to it.
//    For example, ’a’ becomes ’n’ and ’b’ becomes ’o’. The letters “wrap around” at the end, so ’z’ becomes ’m’.
//    Write a method that takes a String and that returns a new String containing the encoded version.
//    You should assume that the String contains upper and lower case letters, and spaces, but no other punctuation.
//        Lower case letters should be tranformed into other lower case letters; upper into upper.
//    You should not encode the spaces.
